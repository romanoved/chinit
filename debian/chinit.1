.TH CHINIT 1


.SH NAME
chinit - change init (run process in new pid namespace)


.SH SYNOPSYS
.B chinit
[\fIoptions\fR]
[\fIcommand\fR]


.SH DESCRIPTION
.B chinit
executes \fIcommand\fR in new pid namespace;
see
.BR  pid_namespace (7)
for more details.
Closing of created pid namespace is garanted
in case of termination of execututed \fIcommand\fR
or any of auxiliary processes,
including initially launched one.
It is guaranteed by kernel
that all descendant processes will be destroyed.


.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BR \-e ", " \-\-exec
Perform exec to given \fIcommand\fR in 'init' process of new namespace instead of fork/exec pair;
see
.BR NOTES
for details.
.TP
.BR \-h ", " \-\-help
Show short help and exit.


.SH EXIT STATUS
Normally
.B chinit
returns exit status of executed command.
If any of auxiliary processes is killed by a signal,
it returns the appropriate status (128 + WTERMSIG(status)).
If internal error occurred, returns EXIT_FAILURE.


.SH NOTES
.B chinit
works only in case of applicability of PR_SET_PDEATHSIG,
so its binary must have an appropriate capabilities.

Implementation scheme:
    root process
        unshare(CLONE_NEWPID)
        drop privileges
        fork
            waitpid for child process
    child process ('init' for new pid namespace):
        set prctl(PR_SET_PDEATHSIG, SIGKILL)
        with --exec option:
            execvp(\fIcommand\fR)
        else:
            fork
                waitpid for child process
        execvp(\fIcommand\fR)


The most common cases of unacceptable are:
    1. running suid binaries (affected to change uid/guid)
    2. run from thread which dies before process finish
This cases can be considered as features of exec
because of PR_SET_PDEATHSIG flag reset.

Since it is difficult to determine if the parent will reset this flag, then by default an additional fork used.
If \fIcommand\fR does not do anything of the above, is is possible to use --exec flag and save one fork.
